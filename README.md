# CoffeeCenter
CoffeeCenter is a teaching project and is being made with the students (year 8-11)in my schools Mobile Development Club.
The aim of this app is to provide options of types of Coffee and then be able to email the order to a coffee shop with the address from where it had been ordered. Also, using SQL Databases, persist all the orders that have been made.
